 PLA in Excel for 13 samples

This PLA (parallel line assay) calculation method is programmed in Microsoft Excel.
The program is designed to calculate up to thirteen potencies from data measured in a 8 by 12 ELISA format or from linear lists with data. Results are grouped per sample on thirteen separated sheets or grouped together in one sheet. Depending on the calculated statistics results are flagged with a colour to identify results with statistical results out of specification.
The PLA calculation method followed was written by Finney and is designed dilutions assays. The measured response of a dilution of a test sample is compared with the response of the same dilution of a standard. By means of analysis of variance a F-test is calculated and used to validate the calculated potency of the test sample.
